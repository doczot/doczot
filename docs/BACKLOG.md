## Integration & Standards

### Use Officially Recognized Format for "Facts About the Platform"
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20
**Category:** Architecture, Interoperability

**Description:**
Instead of custom data models, adopt an officially recognized format for representing API metadata and documentation coverage facts.

**Possible Formats:**
- **GraphQL Schema** - Industry standard for API type systems
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Emerging standard for AI-tool integration
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** - Well-established for REST API documentation
- **JSON Schema** - Language-agnostic schema definition

**Benefits:**
- Better interoperability with other tools
- Standardized tooling/validation
- Easier integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Community familiarity

**Considerations:**
- Migration effort from current Pydantic models
- May be overkill for MVP
- Need to evaluate which standard best fits our use case

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Research MCP adoption in similar tools
- [ ] Evaluate OpenAPI as a potential format
- [ ] Prototype conversion of current models to chosen format
- [ ] Assess community feedback on preferred format

## Accuracy & Customization

### Manual Documentation-to-Code Linking
**Status:** üî• Hot
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20
**Category:** Accuracy, Enterprise Features

**Description:**
Allow organizations to manually create explicit links between code endpoints and documentation sections, improving coverage accuracy for complex cases.

**Use Cases:**
- Documentation in non-standard locations
- Endpoints documented in external systems (Confluence, Notion, etc.)
- Complex monorepo structures
- Endpoints with non-obvious naming patterns

**Proposed Solution:**
```yaml
# .doczot/mappings.yml
manual_links:
  - endpoint:
      method: POST
      path: /api/v1/users
    documentation:
      - file: docs/user-management.md
        section: "Creating Users"
      - file: external/confluence-export.md
        section: "User API"

  - endpoint:
      method: GET
      path: /internal/health
    documentation:
      - file: ops/monitoring.md
        reason: "Internal endpoint, documented in ops guide"
```

**Benefits:**
- Increased accuracy for edge cases
- Handles non-standard documentation
- Enterprise-friendly (supports complex org structures)
- Gradual adoption (can start with just problem endpoints)

**Considerations:**
- Maintenance burden (manual links can become stale)
- Need validation/warning when links break
- Could become crutch instead of improving auto-detection
- Version control complexity

**Implementation Ideas:**
- YAML configuration file (`.doczot/mappings.yml`)
- CLI command: `doczot link <endpoint> <doc-file> [--section]`
- Validation: Warn when linked endpoints/docs don't exist
- Reporting: Show manual vs auto-detected coverage separately

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Design configuration file schema
- [ ] Implement parser for manual links
- [ ] Add validation logic
- [ ] Create CLI commands for link management
- [ ] Add to coverage report (manual vs auto metrics)

## Future Ideas (Unsorted)

### LLM-Powered Documentation Quality Scoring
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20

Beyond just "exists/doesn't exist", use LLM to score documentation quality:
- Completeness (covers all parameters?)
- Clarity (easy to understand?)
- Examples (has working code samples?)
- Up-to-date (matches current implementation?)

### GitHub Actions Integration
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20

Pre-built GitHub Action for CI/CD:
```yaml
- uses: doczot/analyze@v1
  with:
    fail-below: 80
    output-format: markdown
```

### VS Code Extension
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20

Show documentation coverage inline in editor:
- Highlight undocumented endpoints
- Quick links to relevant docs
- "Create documentation" quick action

### Multi-Framework Support
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20

Expand beyond FastAPI:
- Flask
- Django REST Framework
- Express.js
- Spring Boot

### Documentation Templates
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20

Generate documentation stubs for undocumented endpoints:
```markdown
## POST /api/users

<!-- Auto-generated by DocZot -->

**Description:** [TODO: Add description]

**Parameters:**
- `username` (string, required): [TODO: Add description]
- `email` (string, required): [TODO: Add description]

**Response:**
[TODO: Add response format]

**Example:**
[TODO: Add example]
```

### Confluence/Notion Integration
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20

Scan external documentation platforms, not just markdown files.

### Breaking Change Detection
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Date Added:** 2025-10-20

Compare two commits/branches:
- Detect removed endpoints
- Detect changed signatures
- Flag documentation that needs updates
